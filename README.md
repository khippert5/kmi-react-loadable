# react-loadable 16.6+
Replication of: https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable

Supports: React 16.6+ 

### Notes:
This repo was created in order to support the latest React and reduce console errors. The idea of the repo is only to update supported feature until enzyme updates to support suspense and lazy. Ideally, once enzyme has support for react internal features, loadable features should start utilizing Suspense and lazy loading features.
